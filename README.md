# Loan_Repayment---LendingClub_Dataset
## Our Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we will try to build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
